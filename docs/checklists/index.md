# Checklists

The Checklist System is a core execution and tracking mechanism of Career Academy.

All follow-up, progress review, and stage movement are based on checklist usage.
Checklists translate goals into concrete actions and make progress visible for both mentees and Caseworkers.

They exist to ensure consistency, clarity, and accountability across the system.

## Purpose of the Checklist System

Checklists are used to:

- define clear objectives for each stage,
- guide Caseworkers during follow-up,
- help mentees understand expectations,
- standardize execution across different mentorship groups,
- support fair and consistent progress evaluation.

Checklists are not motivational tools.
They are operational tools.

## Stage-Based Checklists

Each mentee is assigned a **stage** through diagnosis.

Each stage has a corresponding checklist that reflects:
- the mentee’s current situation,
- the type of guidance required,
- the appropriate focus at that point.

Stage-based checklists are:
- reviewed during regular meetings,
- logged in the system,
- used to assess readiness for progression.

Progress is measured by execution and engagement, not time spent.

## Career-Oriented Checklists

In addition to stage-based checklists, Career Academy uses
**career-oriented checklists** when a mentee has a clear direction
and requests more specific guidance.

For example:
- a Computer Science–focused checklist may be assigned to mentees pursuing software or technical roles.

Career-oriented checklists:
- are created based on real requests and observed needs,
- supplement stage-based checklists,
- do not replace the core stage structure.

## Future Checklist Development

Career Academy plans to expand the checklist system over time by creating
additional **career-specific checklists**.

These will be developed based on:
- recurring mentee requests,
- patterns observed by Caseworkers,
- and changes in academic or industry expectations.

All future checklists will follow the same principles:
- clear and actionable items,
- flexible pacing,
- documented follow-up.

## Ownership and Responsibility

- **Assigned by:** Admin or Caseworker Director  
- **Completed by:** Mentee  
- **Reviewed by:** Caseworker  

Checklist usage is mandatory within Career Academy.

If a checklist item is not completed and logged, it is treated as incomplete.
