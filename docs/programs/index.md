# Programs Overview

Career Academy operates through a set of structured programs designed to support **mentees and young professionals** at different stages of their career development.

Each program has:
- a defined purpose,
- a clear scope,
- and a specific role within the overall system.

Programs are designed to work **together**.
They are not isolated initiatives, and mentees may interact with more than one program over time.

## How Programs Work Together

Some programs provide **long-term, structured follow-up** (such as Career Academy).
Others act as:
- entry points,
- short-term support mechanisms,
- or continuation paths after structured follow-up is complete.

Movement between programs is based on:
- mentee needs,
- readiness,
- and operational review.

## Initiative and Program Development

Team members are encouraged to **take initiative**, especially around:
- proposing new event ideas,
- identifying common mentee challenges,
- suggesting formats that improve engagement or outcomes.

Event ideas do not need to be fully developed.
A simple problem statement and basic format are enough to start a discussion.

All new program or event ideas are reviewed for:
- relevance,
- feasibility,
- and alignment with Career Academy’s goals.
