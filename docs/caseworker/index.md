This section is a practical guide for **Caseworkers** in Career Academy.

This is an **execution guide**.

## What a Caseworker Is

A Caseworker is responsible for **structured follow-up and tracking**.

Your role is to:
- ensure the mentee understands their assigned stage,
- guide execution through checklists,
- monitor progress and blockers,
- document outcomes in the LOG System.

You are accountable for **process quality**, not for guaranteeing results.

## What a Caseworker Is Not

A Caseworker is **not** expected to:
- provide all answers,
- act as a therapist or counselor,
- solve problems on behalf of mentees,
- give advice outside their experience.

When expertise is required, your role is to **escalate or involve professionals through the system**.
