# Caseworker FAQ

This section answers common questions Caseworkers have during follow-up.

If something is not covered here, escalate to the **Caseworker Director**.

---

## Am I a mentor?

No.

You are a **Caseworker**.  
Your role is to support follow-up, structure, and accountability.

You can share experience when relevant, but your main responsibility is to:
- keep the process moving,
- use checklists,
- document progress.

---

## What if I don’t know the answer to a question?

That’s normal.

You are not expected to know everything.
If a question is outside your experience:
- be honest,
- avoid guessing,
- escalate or involve professionals through the system.

---

## What if the mentee is not making progress?

Start with follow-up:
- check if tasks were clear,
- check if expectations were realistic,
- check if pace needs adjustment.

If lack of progress continues:
- document it,
- discuss it calmly with the mentee,
- escalate to the **Caseworker Director** if needed.

---

## What if a mentee becomes inactive?

Follow up once or twice using the agreed communication method.

If inactivity continues:
- document it,
- escalate to the Caseworker Director.

Do not chase repeatedly or apply pressure.

---

## Can I change a mentee’s stage?

No.

If you believe the stage is incorrect:
- document what you are observing,
- provide concrete examples,
- escalate to the Caseworker Director.

Stage changes are handled centrally.

---

## What if personal or sensitive issues come up?

Acknowledge respectfully.

Do not:
- push for details,
- act as a counselor,
- give personal advice.

If the situation affects follow-up or comfort:
- document it neutrally,
- escalate when appropriate.

---

## How formal should meetings be?

Meetings should be:
- natural,
- respectful,
- professional.

Avoid being:
- overly formal,
- overly personal,
- intrusive.

If something feels uncomfortable, don’t force it.

---

## How detailed should logs be?

Keep logs:
- factual,
- short,
- objective.

Logs are for tracking actions and outcomes, not emotions or opinions.

---

## How am I evaluated as a Caseworker?

You are evaluated on:
- consistency of follow-up,
- checklist usage,
- meeting logs,
- appropriate escalation.

You are **not** evaluated on outcomes you cannot control.

---

## When should I escalate?

Escalate when:
- progress stalls repeatedly,
- expectations don’t match reality,
- issues exceed your role or experience,
- you’re unsure how to proceed.

Escalation is part of the process, not a failure.
