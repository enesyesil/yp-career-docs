# Diagnosis Overview (Caseworker Guide)

Diagnosis is how we make sure a mentee is placed in the **right stage** and receives the **right type of follow-up**.

It is part of the system, not personal judgment.

## Why Diagnosis Matters

Diagnosis helps you:

- understand where the mentee actually stands,
- check whether the assigned stage makes sense,
- avoid pushing someone too fast or holding them back unnecessarily.

When diagnosis is off, progress slows and frustration builds on both sides.

---

## What Diagnosis Looks At

Diagnosis is based on practical signals, such as:

- how clear the mentee’s goals are,
- their education or work background,
- comfort with communication and language,
- confidence in taking action,
- ability to follow through on tasks.

Diagnosis does **not** judge:
- intelligence,
- talent,
- potential,
- or personal value.

## Your Role as a Caseworker

You do **not** decide the diagnosis model.

Your responsibility is to:

- understand the stage the mentee was assigned,
- observe how the mentee actually operates,
- notice when expectations don’t match reality,
- document what you are seeing clearly.

---

## When to Raise a Concern

You should raise a concern if:

- checklist items consistently don’t make sense,
- the mentee seems clearly overwhelmed or under-challenged,
- progress stalls even with proper follow-up,
- the same issues repeat over multiple meetings.

## How to Escalate

If you believe the stage is wrong:

1. Write down what you are observing.
2. Use concrete examples, not opinions.
3. Escalate to the **Caseworker Director**.

Please do not change the stage yourself.

---

## Core Rule

Diagnosis changes **how the system supports the mentee**,  
not **how you respect or treat the mentee**.

Respect stays constant and support matters.
