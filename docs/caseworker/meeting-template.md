# Caseworker–Mentee Meeting Guidelines

Meetings should feel **natural and respectful**, while still being purposeful.

They are:
- not overly formal,
- not personal or intrusive,
- not interventions.

The goal is to create a space where the mentee feels **comfortable, respected, and supported**, while still keeping progress moving.

---

## General Meeting Tone

As a Caseworker, aim for a tone that is:

- calm and conversational,
- professional but human,
- supportive without pressure.

Avoid:
- interrogating the mentee,
- making assumptions about personal issues,
- pushing emotionally sensitive topics,
- framing the meeting as a performance review.

If a topic feels uncomfortable, you do not need to push it.

---

## Purpose of Meetings

Each meeting should gently support:

- checking in on agreed actions,
- understanding what worked or didn’t,
- identifying simple next steps.

Progress matters, but **psychological safety comes first**.

A mentee who feels respected is more likely to stay engaged long term.

---

## First Meeting

The first meeting should focus on:

- getting to know how the mentee prefers to communicate,
- explaining how Career Academy works in simple terms,
- walking through the checklist together,
- setting expectations without pressure.


---

## Regular Meetings

Regular meetings should feel like a **structured conversation**, not a checklist interrogation.

A simple flow works well:

1. **Check-in**
2. **Review agreed actions**
3. **Discuss blockers**
4. **Agree on next steps**

Keep the conversation collaborative.

### Regular Meeting Template

This template is an example, not a script.  
Use it flexibly and adapt to the mentee’s communication style.

---

### 1. Opening (2–3 minutes)

Start naturally.

Examples:
- “How have things been since we last spoke?”
- “Anything important you want to start with today?”

Purpose:
- ease into the conversation,
- make the mentee feel comfortable,
- set a calm tone.

Avoid jumping straight into tasks.

---

### 2. Review of Last Actions

Gently review what was agreed on last time.

Questions you can use:
- “What did you manage to work on?”
- “What felt easier or harder than expected?”

Focus on:
- understanding effort,
- not judging outcomes.

If nothing was completed, stay neutral.

---

### 3. Understanding Blockers (if any)

If progress was limited, explore without pressure.

Examples:
- “Was something unclear?”
- “Did timing or energy make it harder?”
- “Do we need to adjust the pace?”

Avoid:
- blame,
- interrogation,
- personal assumptions.

---

### 4. Decide Next Steps

Agree on **small, realistic actions**.

Questions:
- “What feels reasonable to focus on next?”
- “What would be a good step before our next meeting?”

Make sure:
- actions are clear,
- expectations are shared,
- the mentee agrees with the plan.

---

### 5. Close the Meeting

End with clarity and reassurance.

Examples:
- “Let’s check in on this next time.”
- “If anything comes up before then, feel free to message.”

Purpose:
- leave the mentee feeling supported,
- not pressured.

---

### After the Meeting (Caseworker Only)

- Log the meeting briefly in the LOG System
- Update checklist status
- Note blockers factually, without emotional language

Keep logs short and objective.


---


## Boundaries to Keep in Mind

- Do not act as a therapist or counselor.
- Do not pressure the mentee to disclose personal matters.
- Do not frame feedback as judgment.

If deeper personal issues surface:
- acknowledge them respectfully,
- avoid giving advice,
- escalate to the Caseworker Director if needed.

---

## Relationship Building (Optional but Valuable)

Building a good working relationship helps, but it is **not a requirement**.

If it happens naturally:
- listen actively,
- be consistent,
- follow through on what you say.

Trust grows from reliability, not from being overly personal.

---

## After the Meeting

After each meeting:

- log the meeting briefly in the LOG System,
- update checklist progress,
- note any concerns without judgment.

Logs should be factual, not emotional.

---

## Core Rule

A good meeting leaves the mentee feeling:
- respected,
- understood,
- clear on what comes next.
