# Mentee Onboarding (Caseworker Guide)

This page explains how **Caseworkers onboard a mentee** into Career Academy.

Onboarding sets expectations, explains the system, and establishes how follow-up will work.
If onboarding is weak, everything downstream breaks.

## Purpose of Mentee Onboarding

The goal of onboarding is to ensure that the mentee:

- understands how Career Academy works,
- understands the role of the Caseworker,
- knows what is expected of them,
- agrees to the follow-up structure.


---

## Before the First Meeting

Before onboarding a mentee, you must:

- review the assigned **stage**,
- review the assigned **checklist**,
- understand why this stage was selected,
- prepare to explain the system clearly.

Do not start onboarding if you are not clear on the stage or checklist.

## First Onboarding Meeting

During the onboarding meeting, you must cover:

1. **How the system works**
   - Career Academy is checklist-driven.
   - Progress is tracked and logged.
   - Follow-up is structured, not informal.

2. **Your role as a Caseworker**
   - You guide follow-up and tracking.
   - You are not a mentor or therapist.
   - You escalate when its needed.

3. **The mentee’s role**
   - They execute checklist items.
   - They show up prepared.
   - They communicate blockers early.

4. **Stages and checklists**
   - Explain the assigned stage.
   - Walk through the checklist.
   - Clarify what completion looks like.

5. **Meetings and communication**
   - Meeting frequency
   - Communication channel
   - Expectations for responsiveness

---

## After the Onboarding Meeting

You must:

- log the onboarding meeting in the LOG System,
- confirm checklist status,
- record any early concerns or risks,
- schedule the next meeting.

If onboarding is not logged, it is considered incomplete.

---

## Common Onboarding Mistakes to Avoid

- Skipping system explanation
- Overpromising support or outcomes
- Treating onboarding as a casual conversation
- Avoiding uncomfortable expectation-setting

---

## Escalation Rule

As a Caseworker, you escalate issues to the **Caseworker Director** when needed.

You must escalate if:
- a mentee becomes consistently inactive,
- the assigned stage appears incorrect,
- blockers persist despite follow-up,
- the issue exceeds your role or experience.

Escalation is part of the process. Failing to escalate when required is a process failure.

---

## Core Rule

Onboarding is successful only when:
- expectations are clear on both sides,
- responsibilities are understood,
- and the process is documented.
