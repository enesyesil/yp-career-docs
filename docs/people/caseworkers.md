# Caseworkers

Caseworkers are the **core mentors** of the Career Academy.  
They guide mentees through a structured journey — helping them define goals, build consistency, and connect to opportunities or professional insight when needed.

## 🎯 Purpose

To help mentees **translate goals into action** by providing:
- Personalized planning and accountability  
- Access to Academy resources, checklists, and events  
- Timely support during academic or career uncertainty  
- Structured reflection and documentation at every step  

**Caseworkers ensure that each mentee keeps moving — one realistic step at a time.**

| **Tracking** | Review progress regularly, adjust goals, and log updates. |

##  Core Workflow

1. **Onboarding** – Review mentee’s background, complete the diagnosis form, and set 2–3 initial goals.
