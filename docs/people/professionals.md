# Professionals

Professionals are **on-demand career advisors** who support the Career Academy by offering perspective from real industry experience.  
They are not regular mentors, but trusted contributors who step in when mentees or caseworkers need **career-specific insight** or **networking direction.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To provide occasional, high-impact input that helps mentees make informed career choices.

**They help when:**
- A mentee needs clarity on career paths, industries, or roles  
- A caseworker wants to validate a mentee’s project or strategy with an expert  
- A group session or event requires professional speakers or reviewers

## 🧩 Engagement Style

| Type | Frequency | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Ad-hoc Career Advising** | As needed | Short 1-1 or group chats on role insights, industry culture, or interview readiness |
| **Portfolio/Resume Review** | On request | Quick feedback rounds on projects, portfolios, or applications |
| **Networking Support** | Rare | Sharing relevant connections or opportunities (within comfort and consent) |

## ⚙️ Coordination with Caseworkers
- Caseworkers identify when professional input adds value and facilitate the contact.  
- Communication remains concise, goal-driven, and time-bounded.  
- Caseworkers handle follow-up and documentation — professionals **don’t manage mentee progress.**

---

## 💡 Guidelines
- Keep interactions short and purposeful (15–30 min typical).  
- Offer perspective, not evaluation — focus on “how the industry works.”  
- Share general advice, not confidential company information.  
- Decline or redirect if outside your domain; consistency matters more than availability.

---

## 📊 Expected Impact
- Mentees gain **realistic views** of career paths and work culture.  
- Caseworkers receive **verified advice** to shape mentee action plans.  
- The Academy builds a growing network of professionals who empower the next generation.
