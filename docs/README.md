# What Is Career Academy?

Career Academy is a structured career development system designed to support young people aged 18–35 through continuous one-on-one follow-up.

It operates through a **Caseworker–Mentee matching model**, supported by checklists, logs, resources, and professional advisory input.

Career Academy:

- Is not limited to motivation
- Tracks progress over time
- Measures development through execution
- Documents every step of the process
- Operates as a system, not as a person-dependent initiative

The goal of Career Academy is to ensure that no mentee is left alone in their career journey and that progress is visible, trackable, and sustainable.
