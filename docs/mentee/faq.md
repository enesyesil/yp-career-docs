## 🧭 Getting Started

Once assigned, you’ll complete a short diagnosis and onboarding checklist before your first official meeting.

- A communication channel with your caseworker  
- The onboarding checklist + diagnosis form (your caseworker will provide them)

You may also get shorter check-ins or updates between meetings.

### 5. How long are meetings?
Typically **30–45 minutes**. Some may be shorter (15–20 mins) if focused on progress review.

### 6. What happens in a typical meeting?
- Review your last action items  
- Identify challenges or blockers

## 🪴 Progress & Checklists

### 7. How do the levels work?
Each mentee follows the **YPCA Growth Model**, progressing through four levels:

| Level | Focus | Example Activities |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| **Foundation** | Orientation | Identify habits, goals, and resources |
| **Candidacy** | Readiness | Build resume, learn communication skills |
| **Strategy** | Execution | Apply for opportunities or run mock interviews |
| **Experience** | Reflection | Work, volunteer, and track results |

### 8. How do I know when I move to the next level?
Your caseworker will review your progress and mark when you’ve completed the checklist for your current level.  
This is usually done during a reflection meeting.

### 9. Can I move between different roadmap fields?
Yes — YPCA encourages exploration. You can switch or combine roadmaps (for example, *Data Science + Social Impact*) as long as your caseworker agrees the plan stays realistic.

## 💬 Communication & Support

### 10. What if I can’t attend a meeting?
Let your caseworker know as early as possible and reschedule.  
Consistency matters more than timing — missed meetings slow down your progress.

### 11. Who do I contact if I have a problem?
- **Your Caseworker:** for academic, planning, or motivation issues.  
- **Program Lead:** for larger program-related concerns.  
- **Professionals:** only when your caseworker connects you for specific career advice.

### 12. What if I fall behind?
That’s okay — the goal is to get back on track, not to be perfect.  
Your caseworker will help reset your plan with smaller, achievable steps.

## 🚀 Opportunities & Events

### 13. Will YPCA connect me with real organizations?
Yes — as partnerships grow, mentees will have access to:
- **Workshops and bootcamps**
- **Public service exposure** (e.g., Police Foundations, Firefighter training, etc.)
- **Collaborative projects** with universities or companies

### 14. Can I volunteer or contribute?
Absolutely. You can help improve documentation, join event planning, or become a peer guide once you complete your track.
