# Getting Started — YPCA Career Academy

Welcome to the **YPCA Career Academy (YPCA)** — a structured program designed to help you grow academically, professionally, and personally with guidance and accountability.  

This page will walk you through your **first week** as a mentee and show you how to make the most out of the Academy.

---

##  Step 1 — Understand the YPCA Journey

The Academy helps you move through **four structured levels** of growth:

| Level | Focus | You’ll Learn To |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Build awareness and structure | Identify strengths, habits, and interests |
| **Candidacy** | Prepare for opportunities | Develop a resume, portfolio, and presentation skills |
| **Strategy** | Plan for outcomes | Align skills with real-world roles, practice interviews |
| **Experience** | Act and reflect | Apply for roles, intern, or lead initiatives |

Your **caseworker** will guide you through these stages and track your progress using YPCA checklists and meeting templates.

---

##  Step 2 — Meet Your Caseworker

Your assigned **caseworker** is your main point of contact and accountability partner.

They will:
- Help define your **first goals and action plan**
- Guide you through your **onboarding checklist**
- Walk you through the **diagnosis form**
- Set your meeting cadence and progress system

> 💡 *Your caseworker doesn’t tell you what to do, they help you figure out what matters most and keep you consistent.*

---

##  Step 3 — Complete Your Onboarding Checklist

During your first week, you’ll complete a short onboarding:

- Share your background and interests  
- Fill out the **Diagnosis Form** (skills, goals, blockers)  
- Set 1–2 short-term and 1 long-term goal  
- Join your YPCA workspace or community group  

After completing it, you’ll officially begin at the your determined stage.

---

##  Step 4 — Learn to Document Progress

Every YPCA mentee maintains:
- **Meeting notes** — short summaries after every session  
- **Action list** — 2–3 tasks per cycle  
- **Reflection log** — brief notes on progress, challenges, and learning  

> ✏️ *Documentation turns experience into data, it shows how you’ve improved, even when you forget.*

---

##  Step 5 — Stay Engaged

- Attend all scheduled meetings (biweekly or monthly)  
- Communicate any blockers early  
- Check announcements for workshops, events, and updates  
- Keep your roadmap and checklist updated regularly  

Consistency matters more than speed.

##  Step 6 — Explore Your Study Roadmap

When you’re ready:
- Visit the [Study Roadmaps](study-roadmaps.md) page  
- Discuss your roadmap with your caseworker  
- Focus on the next small milestone, not the entire plan at once

- You complete your goals with clarity and reflection  
- You can explain your growth in academic or professional terms
