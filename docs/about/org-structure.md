## Mentee Stages

Each participant in Career Academy is assigned to **one stage** based on their current career situation.  
The assigned stage determines the **Caseworker approach**, **checklists**, and **focus areas** used for follow-up.

| Stage | Stage Name | Typical Profile | Primary Focus |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Stage 1** | **Foundation** | Individuals with language barriers, low confidence, or unclear direction | Build basic confidence, communication ability, and initial direction |
| **Stage 2** | **Strategy** | Individuals with goals but no clear structure or plan | Create education/career roadmap, decision clarity, accountability |
| **Stage 3** | **Candidacy** | Students or early-career individuals preparing for the next step | Readiness for education, internships, or entry-level roles |
| **Stage 4** | **Experience** | Students or professionals seeking growth and positioning | Skill application, real-world exposure, reflection, career progression |
| **Stage 5** | **Fellowship** | New graduates transitioning into professional life | Career stabilization, long-term planning, professional independence |

**Rule:**  
Each stage has a dedicated checklist and a defined Caseworker follow-up style.


### Caseworkers

Caseworkers are more than mentors.

They:

- Do not only motivate
- Track progress using checklists
- Log meetings and outcomes
- Own the mentee’s journey inside the system

---

### Professionals

Professionals:

- Do not provide continuous mentoring
- Offer support upon request
- Cannot be contacted directly by mentees

All communication with professionals flows through Caseworkers.

---

### Fellowship

After completing their assigned level, participants may enter the **Fellowship** stage.

The Fellowship is focused on **professional continuity, collaboration, and contribution** rather than guided follow-up.

Fellows:
- Support newer participants through structured peer guidance (under Caseworker oversight)
- Contribute to peer-learning or reflection sessions
- Act as a bridge between participants and professionals
- Participate in cross-sector collaboration and opportunity sharing

The primary goal of the Fellowship is to establish a **young professional network** that enables:
- collaboration,
- shared learning,
- access to new opportunities,
- and long-term professional solidarity.

> The Fellowship stage converts individual progress into collective professional capacity.

---

## Scouting and Diagnosis

The process begins with **identification** and **assessment**.

- **Scouting**  
  Identifying potential participants through partners, referrals, or direct outreach.  
  The objective is to identify individuals who can benefit from structured career follow-up.

- **Diagnosis**  
  A structured assessment to understand:
  - current goals,
  - background,
  - constraints,
  - and readiness level.

  This assessment is used to determine the appropriate path and Caseworker follow-up approach.

> The purpose of scouting and diagnosis is to ensure correct placement and appropriate follow-up, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all model.

---

## Log System (Digital Panel System)

The **LOG System** is the central software used to manage and track all Career Academy operations.

It is the **single source of truth** for:
- users,
- matchings,
- checklists,
- meetings,
- and progress records.

---


## Checklist System

The Checklist System defines **how Caseworkers execute follow-up** and **how progress is measured** in Career Academy.

It exists to remove ambiguity from the Caseworker role and to ensure that:
- follow-up is structured,
- objectives are clear,
- and outcomes are documented.

Checklists are not optional guidance tools.  
They are the **core operating mechanism** of the system.

---


##  Leadership and Coordination

Behind the scenes, each operational layer has clear responsibilities:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Program Leads** | Oversee all pathways, evaluate data, and ensure quality. |
| **Caseworkers** | Directly mentor and manage mentee progress. |
| **Fellows** | Extend peer mentorship and assist with onboarding. |
| **Professionals** | Provide domain-specific expertise and feedback. |
| **Operations Team** | Manage tools, checklists, logs, and resources. |

> The structure balances human connection with organized systems — mentorship scaled through clarity, not complexity.

---

##  Summary

- Mentees are placed in **Foundation**, **Strategy**, **Candidacy**, or **Experience** pathways.
