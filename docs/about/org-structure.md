# 🧱 Organizational Structure

Career Academy’s organizational model is designed to support mentorship at scale — without losing the one-on-one connection that defines our work.  
It connects every level of engagement — from mentees and caseworkers to fellows, professionals, and program leadership — into one continuous ecosystem.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The organization is structured around how mentees grow.  
Every participant begins with **Scouting** and **Diagnosis**, then moves through one of four **Caseworker Pathways**.  
Each pathway focuses on a different stage of readiness and development, leading ultimately to the **Fellowship** and **Professional Network**.

---

## 🩺 Scouting and Diagnosis

The journey begins with outreach and onboarding:
- **Scouting** – identifying potential mentees through community, partner, or referral networks.  
- **Diagnosis** – understanding each mentee’s goals, background, and readiness to determine their ideal pathway.

> The goal is to connect every mentee to the right kind of guidance — not a one-size-fits-all program.

---

## 🧩 Caseworker Pathways

Each mentee is assigned to a **Caseworker Pathway** that matches their developmental stage.  
These pathways define what kind of mentorship, checklists, and goals will be used.

| Caseworker Type | Ideal Mentee Profile | Focus Area |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Mentees who are uncertain or face language/confidence barriers. | Build confidence, motivation, and direction. |
| **Strategy** | Mentees with goals but lacking structure. | Create career/education roadmaps and accountability systems. |
| **Candidacy** | Mentees preparing for higher education or entry-level jobs. | Develop readiness, professional skills, and mindset. |
| **Experience** | Students or professionals seeking career growth. | Build applied skills, real-world exposure, and reflection. |

Each pathway is guided by caseworkers specialized in that area, supported by program coordinators and peer fellows.

### 🪜 Fellowship

After completing their pathway, mentees enter the **Fellowship** — a stage focused on leadership, contribution, and community.  

Fellows:
- Mentor new mentees under supervision of caseworkers.  
- Host peer-learning or reflection sessions.  
- Represent the bridge between mentees and professionals.  

> The Fellowship stage transforms growth into contribution — mentees become mentors.

## 🧠 Leadership and Coordination

Behind the scenes, each operational layer has clear responsibilities:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Program Leads** | Oversee all pathways, evaluate data, and ensure quality. |
| **Caseworkers** | Directly mentor and manage mentee progress. |
| **Fellows** | Extend peer mentorship and assist with onboarding. |
| **Professionals** | Provide domain-specific expertise and feedback. |
| **Operations Team** | Manage tools, checklists, logs, and resources. |

> The structure balances human connection with organized systems — mentorship scaled through clarity, not complexity.
