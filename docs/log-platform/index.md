# Log Platform

The Log Platform is the system used to record and track activity within Career Academy.

It exists to ensure continuity, clarity, and accountability across the program.
Logs allow the system to function consistently even when Caseworkers or roles change.

The Log Platform supports:
- Caseworker follow-up,
- checklist tracking,
- escalation and review,
- program-level visibility.

Logs are factual records.
They are not evaluations, opinions, or personal notes.

## Why the Log Platform Exists

Without a shared logging system:
- progress becomes inconsistent,
- follow-up depends on individuals,
- institutional knowledge is lost.

The Log Platform ensures that:
- actions are documented,
- decisions are traceable,
- and support remains consistent over time.

## What the Log Platform Is Not

The Log Platform is **not**:
- a performance scoring system,
- a personal journal,
- or a place for subjective commentary.

It is a practical operational tool used to support the system as a whole.
