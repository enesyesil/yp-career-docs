# Log Platform — Usage & Governance

This page defines what is logged, who is responsible, and how logs are used
for review and escalation.

---

## What Is Logged

The following items must be recorded in the Log Platform:

- mentee onboarding completion
- assigned stage
- assigned checklists
- meeting dates and attendance
- checklist progress updates
- major decisions or changes
- escalations and their outcomes

If something is not logged, it might be treated as not completed.

---

## How Logs Should Be Written

Logs must be:
- brief,
- factual,
- neutral in tone.

Logs describe **what happened**, not interpretations, judgments, or assumptions.

---

## What Should Not Be Logged

Do not log:
- sensitive personal information,
- mental health details,
- family or financial matters,
- subjective opinions.

If an issue affects follow-up but is sensitive,
log only the operational impact and escalate when needed.

## Responsibilities

### Caseworkers
- log meetings and attendance,
- update checklist progress,
- document blockers or delays,
- flag issues requiring escalation.

### Mentees
- complete checklist items,
- communicate blockers or delays,
- attend scheduled meetings.


### Caseworker Director / Admin
- review logs regularly,
- identify patterns or recurring issues,
- make stage or assignment decisions,
- handle escalations.

## Escalation and Review

Logs support escalation and review decisions.

Escalation may occur when:
- progress stalls repeatedly,
- engagement drops,
- stage placement appears incorrect,
- issues exceed the Caseworker’s role.

Escalation is recorded in the Log Platform.
