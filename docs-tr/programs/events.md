# Events Program

The Events Program supports both Career Academy and our wider community.

Events are designed to activate, motivate, and connect students through practical, focused sessions — not just to “fill a calendar”.  

Every event must solve a real problem and move students forward.

## 1. Types of Events

We run four main categories of events. Each has a specific purpose and outcome.

### **1. Workshops**
Structured 60–90 minute sessions.

Common themes:
- Planning your semester  
- Resume and LinkedIn clinics  
- How to talk to professionals  
- Improving study discipline  

**Purpose:**  
Teach 1–2 actionable skills and help students leave with something *completed*, not just learned.

---

### **2. Clinics / Office Hours**
Short, focused 1:1 or small-group sessions (10–25 minutes each).

Examples:
- Resume reviews  
- Quick career Q&A  
- Statement of interest feedback  

**Purpose:**  
Give direct, personalized guidance quickly.

---

### **3. Co-Working / Study Sessions**
Low-pressure productivity sessions (2–3 hours).

Examples:
- “Application Sprint”  
- “Deep Work Sunday”  
- “Finish Your Assignments”  

**Purpose:**  
Provide accountability, reduce isolation, and help students build study momentum.

---

### **4. Community & Networking Events**
Panels, group discussions, or informal mixers.

Examples:
- Industry panels  
- Stories from transfer students  
- Hidden gems: Pathways into tech / healthcare / business  

**Purpose:**  
Show students real journeys, reduce stigma, and build confidence through community.

## 2. Event Design Principles

Events must follow these core principles:

### **1. Problem-First Design**
Every event must answer the question:  
**“What struggle is this solving?”**

If an event does not solve a real problem, we don’t run it.

---

### **2. Clear Outcomes**
Students should leave with at least one concrete result, such as:
- A finished resume section  
- A semester plan  
- A clarified career direction  
- A list of networking targets  

---

### **3. Low Friction**
Make it easy for students to join:
- Clear time and location  
- Simple language  
- No unnecessary sign-up barriers  

---

### **4. Follow-Up Built In**
Events are not standalone. They should lead students into:
- Career Academy  
- 1:1 meetings  
- Additional resources  
- Templates or guides  

---

## 3. Event Lifecycle

How every event should be designed, executed, and closed out.

### **Step 1 — Proposal**
Anyone on the team can suggest an event. A short proposal includes:
- Target audience  
- Problem being solved  
- Format & length  
- Timing  

---

### **Step 2 — Approval & Scheduling**
Check for:
- Conflicts with exams or holidays  
- Available facilitators  
- Repetition with past events  

Once approved:
- Add to calendar  
- Assign an Event Lead  

---

### **Step 3 — Preparation**
The Event Lead prepares a simple run-of-show:

Includes:
- Opening script  
- Timing breakdown  
- Slides or handouts  
- Tech setup  
- Guest confirmations (if needed)

---

### **Step 4 — Promotion**
Use simple messaging with:
- Clear benefits  
- Problem it solves (“If you struggle with X…”)  
- 3 bullets on what students will get  
- Registration or RSVP  

Channels:
- Discord  
- WhatsApp  
- Email  
- Posters / campus flyers  

---

### **Step 5 — Running the Event**
During the event:
- Start on time  
- Briefly explain who we are  
- Keep the tone friendly, practical, and non-judgmental  
- Collect attendance  
- Gather quick feedback (optional)  

---

### **Step 6 — Follow-Up**
Within 48 hours:
- Send slides, notes, or templates  
- Invite students to book 1:1s  
- Notify caseworkers of students needing follow-up  
- Log event details in data system (attendance, feedback, outcomes)

## 5. Connecting Events to Other Programs

- **Career Academy**  
  Events act as an entry point; many mentees begin here.

- **Outreach Film & Media**  
  Events provide opportunities for capturing stories, testimonials, and community footage.

- **Surveys & Data**  
  Event attendance and feedback help identify trends:
  - What topics students struggle with most  
  - Which events lead to the most follow-up  
  - Which problems are becoming more common  

---

Events are not about entertainment — they are about movement.  
Each event should help a student take one step forward, however small.
