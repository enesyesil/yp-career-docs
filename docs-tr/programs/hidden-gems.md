# Hidden Gems Program

Hidden Gems is our signature career-exploration series.  
Its goal is simple: **help students discover high-demand, stable, and meaningful careers that are often overlooked — and connect them directly with professionals working in those fields.**

These careers are “hidden” not because they are rare, but because most students **never hear about them**, don’t know where to start, or assume they are “too hard” or “not for them”.

Hidden Gems fixes that by bringing real frontline experts, instructors, and professionals into the room to share their journey, requirements, and advice.

## 1. Purpose of Hidden Gems

Hidden Gems exists to:

- Expose students to **high-demand careers** they wouldn’t normally consider  
- Break stereotypes about “traditional” career paths  
- Provide clarity on certifications, training pathways, and provincial differences  
- Give students **direct access** to professionals and HR perspectives  
- Help students find stable, mission-driven careers in Canada  
- Build confidence through real stories and open Q&A  

Our board and program team actively research industries to identify roles where:
- Demand is rising  
- Entry requirements are realistic  
- Stability and long-term growth are strong  
- Students lack awareness

## 2. The Hidden Gems Approach

Each Hidden Gems event uses a consistent formula:

### **1. Identify a sector with strong opportunities**
Examples:
- Public service  
- Healthcare  
- Education

### **2. Invite professionals who actually work in the field**
We look for people who can speak honestly about:
- Their path into the career  
- What training and certifications were required  
- What surprised them  
- Advice for newcomers and students  

### **3. Provide a clean, structured breakdown during the event**
Every event covers:
- What the career looks like  
- Required certifications  
- Salary ranges & career progression  
- Provincial differences  
- Day-to-day reality  
- How to prepare in university or college  
- How to apply or gain relevant experience  

### **4. Make it interactive**
Students have opportunities to ask:
- Personal questions
