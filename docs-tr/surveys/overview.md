# Surveys Overview

Understanding the real challenges faced by young people is essential to building programs that actually work. Our focus is specifically on **young professionals and young-professional candidates**, primarily university and college students aged **18–30**. This age group faces a unique mix of financial pressure, mental-health strain, career uncertainty, and skills-development needs.

We currently rely on **external Canadian surveys** from government agencies, national student organizations, major research institutes, and university-led studies. These sources provide a reliable picture of what young adults (18–30) experience across Canada.

## Why We Use Surveys

Surveys help us:

- Ground our programs in **real evidence**, not assumptions  
- Understand the pressures that most affect young adults aged 18–30  
- Track trends in **youth/young professional employment**  
- Identify **skills gaps**, including GenAI readiness  
- Recognize challenges young people face in accessing campus support  
- Design programs that are **practical, realistic, and non-judgmental**  

Our goal is to turn this research into **direct support** through:

- Career Academy  
- Hidden Gems  
- Synergy Meetups  
- Mentee templates and tools  
- Caseworker training and development

## What Our Surveys Focus On

We organize our understanding of the 18–30 demographic around five themes:

### **1. Financial Pressures**
Young adults face high stress related to tuition, housing, groceries, part-time work, and cost of living.

### **2. Mental Health & Wellbeing**
National surveys show high levels of stress, exhaustion, anxiety, and post-pandemic challenges among people aged 18–30.

### **3. Youth & Young Professional Employment**
Unemployment rates for ages 15–24 and early-career adults (up to 30) remain significantly higher than general unemployment, affecting students and new graduates.

### **4. Skills & GenAI Preparedness**
Many young adults use AI tools daily, but still feel unprepared to use them in professional settings.

### **5. Campus Resource Engagement**
Students 18–30 often delay using campus services until late in their degree or feel unsure where to start.

## Our Data Approach

Right now, we **outsource our research** by relying on trusted third-party Canadian studies from:

- Statistics Canada  
- ESDC (Employment and Social Development Canada)  
- CASA (Canadian Alliance of Student Associations)  
- MHCC (Mental Health Commission of Canada)  
- HEQCO (Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario)  
- TD, KPMG, and other national research groups  
- University campus-wide surveys  

These sources help us understand the lived reality of young adults aged 18–30.

As our community grows, we plan to conduct **our own internal surveys**, such as:

- Small-scale periodic check-ins  
- Targeted surveys for mentees and caseworkers  
- Comparative analysis with national data  
- Early detection of emerging needs  
- More refined program and resource design  

For now, external studies provide our baseline.  
Soon, our own data will help us tailor support even more precisely.
