# Quick Guide: How to Make a Resume

This is a short, simple guide for students who want to build a clean, effective resume fast — without overthinking.

Follow these steps in order.

---

## 1. Start With a Clean Structure

Your resume should include these sections in this exact order:

1. **Header**
2. **Summary (2–3 sentences)**
3. **Education**
4. **Experience** (jobs, internships, volunteering)
5. **Projects** (if you have any)
6. **Skills**

One page only. No photos. No fancy colors.

---

## 2. Write a Simple Header

Example:

**Your Name**  
City, Province · email@example.com · (123) 456-7890  
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourprofile  
GitHub/Portfolio (optional)

Keep it short and clean.

---

## 3. Add a 2–3 Sentence Summary

Purpose: explain who you are and what direction you're going.

Example:

> Third-year Computer Science student interested in software development and data engineering. Experienced with Python, Java, and backend projects. Looking for internships to grow technical and teamwork skills.

---

## 4. Education Section

Example:

**York University** — BSc Computer Science (2021–2025)  
Relevant Courses: Data Structures, Databases, Algorithms, Web Development

---

## 5. Experience Section

Use 2–3 strong bullets per role.

Each bullet should follow this formula:

**Action + Result**

Bad:  
- Worked on backend  
- Helped customers

Good:  
- Built backend features using Python that reduced manual work by 30%  
- Helped 20+ customers weekly by solving onboarding issues

If you don’t have job experience, list:
- Volunteering  
- School projects  
- Club roles  
- Tutoring  

---

## 6. Add a Projects Section

Include 1–3 simple projects.

Format:

**Project Name** — one-sentence description  
- Tools used: X, Y, Z  
- What you built or improved  

Example:

**Task Manager App** — built a simple full-stack app  
- Tools: React, Node.js, MongoDB  
- Implemented login system and task CRUD operations  

---

## 7. Skills Section

Keep it short and grouped:

**Programming:** Python, Java, JavaScript  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, PostgreSQL  
**Soft Skills:** teamwork, communication, problem-solving  

Never list skills you don’t actually have.

---

- One page
