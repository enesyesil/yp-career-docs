# Mentees

Mentees are the **core participants** of the Career Academy.  
Each mentee is paired with a caseworker who helps them build direction, consistency, and measurable growth toward academic or career goals.

---

##  Purpose
The mentee’s role is to take *active ownership* of their progress.  
The caseworker and professors can support, but the mentee drives the action.

##  Responsibilities

| Area | Expectation |
|------|--------------|
| **Engagement** | Attend scheduled meetings and respond to check-ins. |
| **Documentation** | Keep your roadmap, tracker, and checklist updated. |
| **Reflection** | After each meeting, write a short note: what worked, what didn’t. |
| **Follow-through** | Complete agreed tasks before the next session. |
| **Communication** | Ask questions early; be honest about constraints. |

## How to Work with Your Caseworker
1. **Prepare** before each session — list updates, blockers, and next goals.  
2. **Focus** on what’s actionable — 2–3 small steps are better than vague ambitions.  
3. **Document** everything in shared notes or trackers.  
4. **Reflect** — what did you learn, and what’s next?

##  Growth Path

| Level | Description | Example Focus |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Orientation & self-assessment | Setting academic plan, learning tools |
| **Candidacy** | Building professional readiness | Resume, projects, networking |
| **Strategy** | Targeted career plan | Internship prep, mock interviews |
| **Experience** | Real-world execution | Applying, interning, reflecting |

> 💡 *The program works best when you treat it like a long-term partnership — your caseworker helps you think, but you decide and act.*
